# DESCRIPTION:
# We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.
#
# Each turn, we choose the two heaviest stones and smash them together.
# Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.  The result of this smash is:
#
# If x == y, both stones are totally destroyed;
# If x != y, the stone of weight x is totally destroyed,
# and the stone of weight y has new weight y-x.
# At the end, there is at most 1 stone left.
# Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

# EXAMPLE
# Input: [2,7,4,1,8,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
# we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
# we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
# we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1]
# then that's the value of last stone.
