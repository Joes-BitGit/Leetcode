# Say you have an array prices for which the ith element
# is the price of a given stock on day i.

# Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
# You may complete as many transactions as you like
# (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

# Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time
# (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

# EXAMPLE
# Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
# Output: 7
# Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
#              Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.

        Suppose the first sequence is "a <= b <= c <= d",
        the profit is "d - a = (b - a) + (c - b) + (d - c)" without a doubt.
        And suppose another one is "a <= b >= b' <= c <= d",
        the profit is not difficult to be figured out as "(b - a) + (d - b')".
        So you just target at monotone sequences.
